# MTCLIM Model Open Source Philosophy

MTCLIM is Open Source software.  We have licensed the source code with the [GNU GPL v3.0 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).  This license provides very few restrictions on use.

Our rationale for moving the MTCLIM model development to the open source community is that we want:
- to encourage other researchers and developers to contribute to the MTCLIM development,  and
- to facilitate transparent development and use of the model

## Official Support

The MTCLIM development community assumes the role of a limited scope of official support.

- Coordination of model development, bug fixes, and releases.
- Distribution of model [documentation](http://mtclim.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [source code](https://github.com/jhamman/mtclim)

## Unsupported

Due to limited resources, there is not official support for some of the tasks related to using MTCLIM.  We expected that the user comes prepared with some understanding of the model and scientific computing.  As such, these items are specifically not supported by the MTCLIM development community:

- Building and running the MTCLIM model on platforms other than LINUX, UNIX, and OSX.
- Using LINUX, UNIX, or OSX operating systems.
- Development of project specific features.
- Configuring individual model applications.
